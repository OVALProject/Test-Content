This document contains a log of all changes made to the OVAL Test Content since Version 5.9.1 was released.

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.10.1 build 3   ---
---------------------------------------

* Updated evr_string values to explicitly follow the EPOCH:VERSION-RELEASE format.
* Implemented feature request #3570530: update rpmverify*_test content to support FC17+.
* Fixed bug #3448310: solaris patch tst:1981 incorrectly references ste:1298.
* Fixed bug #3448288: remove unix-def:runlevel_test content for macos.
* Fixed bug #3448321: solaris file test tst:1879 references the wrong state.
* Fixed bug #3525114: oval:org.mitre.oval.test:def:219 is duplicated in Windows content.
* Fixed bug #3438322: remove the signature_keyid entity from the rpminfo_test.
* Fixed bug #3433695: file_test content has an object and state that do not align.
* Fixed bug #3433692: process tests dont use full path for command entity on mac.
* Added content for the windows_view behavior in the win-def:file_test and the win-def:registry_test content.
* Added ind-def:environmentvariable58_test content for Windows and Linux.
* Changed "path" object entity operations to "case insensitive equals" because the Windows directory was "C:\Windows" but the test had "C:\WINDOWS" in the ind-def:filehash58_test content.
* Fixed capitalization errors that were causing tests to fail in the MacOS and Linux ind-def:xmlfilecontent_test content.

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.10.1 build 2   ---
---------------------------------------

* Fixed some objects and states to use the proper case for path names in the Solaris ind-def:xmlfilecontent_test content.  They weren't matching the support data they were intended to operate on.
* Fixed all the xml test files to not have an extra top-level terms_of_use element, which is not legal xml.
* Changed path and filename operations in the ind-def:filehash58_test content for Windows to be case insensitive.

---------------------------------------
---        Version 5.9 build 2      ---
---------------------------------------

* Changed the datatype of the chg_allow and exp_warn entities from "string" to "int" to resolve validation errors in the unix-def_shadow_test.xml files. 
* Added platform specific OVAL Variables Documents to align with the OVAL Variable identifiers in each of the oval-def_external_variable.xml files. 
* Changed the linux-def_selinuxboolean_test.xml file so that it specified the var_ref property instead of the entity_check property. 
* Added "independent-definitions-schema" to the schemaLocation attribute of the oval_definitions element to resolve validation errors. 
* Changed the datatypes and operations of the local_port object and state entities in the linux-def_inetlisteningservers_test.xml file to resolve validation errors. 
* Changed the datatypes and operations of the local_port state entities in the macos-def_inetlisteningservers_test.xml file to resolve validation errors. 
* Updated the oval-def_split_function.xml files so that they now utilize the ability to specify the empty string value in a constant_variable. 
* Added ind-def_textfilecontent_test.xml to the Windows content. 
* Added oval_check_enumeration_object_state.xml to the Windows content. 
* Added win-def_fileauditedpermissions_test.xml to the Windows content. 
* Added win-def:fileeffectiverights_test.xml to the Windows content. 
* Added win-def:process58_test.xml to the Windows content. 
* Added win-def_regkeyauditedpermissions53_test.xml to the Windows content. 
* Added win-def_regkeyauditedpermissions_test.xml to the Windows content. 
* Added win-def_regkeyeffectiverights_test.xml to the Windows content. 
* Added win-def_wmi57_object_test.xml to the Windows content. 
* Commented out the test case that uses the 'not equal' operation in win-def_file_test.xml because it takes a very long time to complete. 
* Removed trailing path separators from all content. 
* Updated win-def_user_sid55_test.xml so that it no longer checks for the system account (S-1-5-18). 
* Changed the datatypes and operations on the state entities in linux-def_dpkginfo_test.xml to resolve validation errors.
