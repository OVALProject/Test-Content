OVAL Test Content
============

The OVAL Test Content is a set of OVAL Definitions that provides a simple way to test the capability of OVAL Definition Evaluators. After running the OVAL Test Content through an OVAL Definition Evaluator, the OVAL Results will show the user which tests are properly supported by that tool. This allows users to perform unit testing of tools against the OVAL Language. Over time, the OVAL Test Content will cover the basic behavior of all tests and capabilities in the OVAL Language.
